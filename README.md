# Instant-Revive

After you press revive there is a few seconds delay before you can actually move and use skills, which is frequently enough for you to die again (under new boss attack or just in some sort of ground-puddle aoe damage such as fire on Bahaars arena edges), but now with this module:  
You can **revive instantly** without the "getting up" animation and start moving and using skills right away!  
Also works on your party members! So you can lock onto them as Priest and use pull or heal right away, saving them from Bahaars fire or anything else as soon as they hit their "revive" button!  

# Commands  
- !`irevive` to toggle module (DEFAULT: ON)  
- !`irevive party` to toggle party functions which are useful if you are a Priest (DEFAULT: OFF)  
- !`irevive drama` to toggle drama when dying (DEFAULT: OFF) (during dying (first 5 sec) animation dead body might be slightly in the wrong place for ressurection visually on your screen)   

# Notes

also disables black & white screen effect when you die
